Program to create a curated reddit feed based on user interests.

With the huge amount of information in Reddit, it's easy to lose track of time while swiping through the feed. In this program, I have a list of 6 subreddits that I visit often. I am scraping data for hot posts from each of these subreddits and choosing the top 5 posts for each subreddit by score.

These posts are then compiled, with details such as subreddit, title and URL of each post. This curated feed is then mailed to the user's email ID.
